## 🔧 About Me

I’m an **Embedded Systems Developer** passionate about blending hardware with intelligent software. My work lies at the intersection of **firmware development**, **real-time systems**, and **embedded AI**. I design and develop firmware for STM32-based embedded prototypes, integrating different sensors and components for diverse applications including medical, industrial, and assistive technology.

- ⚙️ Hands-on with **STM32**, **bare-metal C**, and **sensors**
- 🔬 Former **Firmware Intern** at **Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore**
- 📚 Published multiple **patents** and two **peer-reviewed research paper**
- 💡 Building impactful solutions using embedded tech

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### ⚒️ Dual-Bank Firmware Update Bootloader for STM32
> *STM32CubeIDE · UART Communication · Dual-Bank Flash Memory · CRC Integrity Check*
- Designed and implemented a **dual-bank bootloader** enabling seamless firmware updates without interrupting active code execution.  
- Unitlized a **Python host application** to transfer `.bin` files via UART, packet framing, CRC32 validation, and data transmission.  
- Implemented **bank switching logic** to write new firmware onto the inactive bank and update the active bank pointer.
  
### 👕 Vitals Monitoring Wearable Vest
> *STM32CubeIDE | SPI | I2C | UART | FATFS*
- Integrated multiple sensors (ECG, EMG, GSR, Temp., IMU) on STM32 platform.
- Logged vitals to SD card for post-processing and live monitoring.

### ⚙️ Baremetal Driver Development
> *C | Baremetal | STM32L496ZG-P | Logic Analyzer*
- Created custom SPI, UART, I2C drivers with polling and interrupt modes.
- Successfully interfaced STM32 with Arduino sensors using custom packets.
